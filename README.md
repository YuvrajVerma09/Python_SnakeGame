# Python_SnakeGame
This is the code and libraries for a snake game designed by me!
You have permission to change what you want but not too much. 
In this game it is important to have all the files and libraries installed.
This included pygame and is you want you can add the math library so that you are able to add different functions.
If you have any suggestions, message me!
